### Motivation
The community in Samara, Costa Rica has been transformed from a small village to a small city-like beach town due to post-pandemic mass migration and gentrification. Native locals are still being paid under $3.00 per hour most of the time and do not have enough work. This network will provide opportunities to those who donâ€™t speak english and have no financial means to advertise.

This online hub will be to help support the native Costa Rican community by connecting folks who need work done, such as homeowners or small businesses with local expertise, in need of employment. Wages will be suggested comparable to property manager costs for the same service and given entirely to job seeker to truly enhance their lives!
